PDF BATCH PROCESSOR - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================

INITIAL SETUP (One-time only)
------------------------------

1. INSTALL PYTHON (if not already installed)
   - Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, CHECK THE BOX: "Add Python to PATH"
   - This is very important!

2. INSTALL REQUIRED LIBRARIES
   - Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in Windows)
   - Copy and paste these commands one at a time:
   
     pip install pdfplumber
     pip install pypdf
     pip install openpyxl

3. PLACE FILES IN YOUR FOLDER
   - Copy these files to your "daily printing" folder:
     * batch_process.py
     * RUN_PDF_PROCESSOR.bat
   
   Your folder structure should look like:
   
   daily printing/
   ├── batch_process.py
   ├── RUN_PDF_PROCESSOR.bat
   ├── document1.pdf
   ├── document2.pdf
   └── ... (other PDF files)


DAILY USAGE
-----------

1. Place all PDF files to process in the "daily printing" folder

2. Double-click "RUN_PDF_PROCESSOR.bat"

3. Wait for processing to complete (a window will open and show progress)

4. When finished, you'll see:
   - "add to service charges.xlsx" created in the main folder
   - "Print these" folder created with:
     * combined_alphabetical.pdf (sorted, ready to print)
     * Any multi-page PDFs (copied for printing)

5. Print the files in the "Print these" folder


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you see "Python is not recognized":
- Python is not installed or not added to PATH
- Reinstall Python and CHECK "Add Python to PATH"

If you see "No module named 'pdfplumber'":
- Required libraries not installed
- Run the pip install commands from step 2 above

If the batch file doesn't work:
- Make sure batch_process.py is in the same folder
- Make sure there are PDF files in the folder to process
